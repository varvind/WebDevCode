        <p>Of course we love all our vacations, but some are innevitably better than others and here is why</p>
        <h4><u>1. Iceland</u></h4>
        <p>Iceland was magestic in every way, and it was unlike anything we have ever done before. <br>
            In every sense this trip was awesome, down to the breathtaking views and of course the fact that <br>
            we went with some of our closest friends was the the final cherry on top. <br>

            "The moraine lake was beautiful and we sat down did some kayaking. that day we saw the bear in the <br> 
            in iceberg lake, we walked for 5hrs to see the iceberg lake" - Anubhav Venkatesan

        <h4><u>3. Switzerland</u> </h4>
            <p>
                Our most recent trip, and by far the nicest in terms of picture quality. This trip was interesting because <br>
                apparently one of the biggest heat waves in europe had hit us then, so as you can imagine, sweating in the swiss alps <br>
                was not what we were thinking was going to happen :) We persisted and saw amazing things that only europe could offer,
                not to mention one of us jumping off a cliff!!
